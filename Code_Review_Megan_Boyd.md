On a scale of 1 to 5, I give this code a rating of 5 based on the following criteria:

1  The program has syntax errors and does not compile, or the project does not provide sufficient information to instal necessary dependencies.
2  The program compiles successfully but generates runtime errors. or the project does not contain sufficeint instructions to run the program.
3  The program compiles and runs but does not perform correctly and does not produce correct results
4  The program compiles and produces correct output but does not follow assignment/class guidelines or is insufficiently documented
5  The program produces correct output and is well written and well documented

Suggestions for improving the project:
The Client works great.
It is very annoying having to open up so many tabs - I ended up needing 9 clients to open, not 8 like the program says 
I ran into a never ending loop from the Server side, I suggest your group looks into that.
I am not that familiar with mafia so I would include more instructions
