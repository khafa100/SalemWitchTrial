On a scale of 1 to 5, I give this program and code a 5:

1 The program has syntax errors and does not compile, or the project does not
provide sufficient information to instal necessary dependencies. 2 The program
compiles successfully but generates runtime errors. or the project does not 
contain sufficeint instructions to run the program. 3 The program compiles and
runs but does not perform correctly and does not produce correct results 4 The
program compiles and produces correct output but does not follow
assignment/class guidelines or is insufficiently documented 5 The program 
produces correct output and is well written and well documented


The program itself is well documented and has good implementation but I can 
really see this game was meant for a multiple devices. Not too sure opening 10 
windows is convenient to initialize the game. Game says that you only need
8 players but it calls for one extra one for some reason. Some things I did notice
is that the readme itself could use a little more instruction when playing this game.
Although I am familiar with the purpose of the game, I'm pretty sure there
are people who will be trying out your program and have no idea how to play.
I was able to get about a one round but no deaths occurred. There's a voting
that occurs before the mafia even makes a "hit" on the person. I always
thought the town would vote who to kill after one killing. However, it is your
program. For the most part it is a smooth, aside from the assumption that the
timers that show only end if you press enter. Pretty sure the whole timer
situation is another deal, but it just a thought. Again, it's good that you
have to option to do localhost or type in a server because I feel the only 
effective way to play this game, is if all the players were using 
different devices, so that way they all can actually keep to themselves, since
that is the purpose of this game, which is to be discrete and survive.
